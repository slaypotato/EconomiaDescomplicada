* Gama Experience #10 - Task 1
This was the first task we had to complete at the Gama Experience as a team. We were asked to build a site / blog about loans and financing and, in one week, get 1100 leads with. There were some ground rules, like a limit we could spend on ads, and other marketing stuff. The main restriction for the technology team was that we could NOT use any blog platform (wordpress, joomla, etc.) to build the site on. We did it, it is not perfect, but we earned the first place.
